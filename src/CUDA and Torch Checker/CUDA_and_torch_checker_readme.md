# CUDA and Torch Checker

### Note: I strongly recommend using python's package manager 'pip' for installing the script's package requirements (as well as using an environmental variable!).

## Requirements: 
    1. CUDA (to be installed on system)
    2. pytorch (recommend using python's package manager 'pip'.)

## Information:
```
    Script checks current CUDA and torch versions (and if both are correctly configured and installed on the current system, and if they are both correctly set in the system's $PATH system environment variable to be used).
```
